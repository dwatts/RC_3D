            <p>Resurrection City was not constructed all at once in the summer of 1968. Over the course of several weeks, coordinated groups of volunteers from across the country, in coordination with architects and planners Tunney Lee, Ken Jadin, and John Wiebenson, mapped out and built the 519 structures that would eventually make up Resurrection City.</p>
            <p>Resurrection City, like any human settlement, served important functions around shelter, organizing social networks, and providing critical infrastructures such as sanitation, education, health care, and more. But it was also a vital staging ground for organized political activities, from large-scale protests like Solidarity Day on June 19, 1968 to more coordinated, strategic lobbying efforts that sprawled across the District's federal agencies.</p><p>In this map, we reconstruct Resurrection City in three dimensions.

            <p>John Wiebenson, a professor of architecture at the University of Maryland, College Park, created these diagrams that show the purposeful mix of private and public areas created in Resurrection City, some of which were created in part by their design and others happened organically through use.</p>
            <img class="app-image" src="./assets/images/Wiebenson_1.png" alt="John Wiebenson Resurrection City schematic plan">
            <p>They designed the most public areas like the information center and registration booths, at the western edge of the main pedestrian entrance. Resurrection City's 'Main Street' was where reporters, celebrities, federal officials, and visitors could access the encampment when the city was open to the greater public.</p>
            <img class="app-image" src="./assets/images/Wiebenson_2.png" alt="John Wiebenson Resurrection City schematic plan">
            <p>Just as in any other 'city', Resurrection City's architects used a classic modernist city planning approach, with a main street, 'publicly' accessible service sites along the main axis, and clusters of different residential “neighborhoods” growing outward according to a loose but clear linear plan, neighborhoods of private living spaces. The story of Resurrection City as a complex but ephemeral settlement built in the midst of all the unquestioned permanence of the Mall's monuments is remarkable - and indiscernible to visitors today.</p>

                <h3>1. Entrance</h3>
                <p>Resurrection City, the “City of Hope,” officially opened on May 13, 1968. After extensive negotiations over site selection with the National Park Service, the White House, and the Justice Department, representatives from the SCLC and Poor People's Campaign obtained a 4-week permit to set up the encampment on a 16-acre site of West Potomac Park. Bounded by the Reflecting Pool, Independence Avenue, the Lincoln Memorial, and Seventeenth Street NW, Resurrection City would be constructed by a team of volunteers over the next several weeks, starting from the end closest to the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
                <p>This photograph shows a view of the Registration tent just inside the City's boundaries. Protestors, many arriving via caravans that shepherded thousands of protestors a total of 13,000 miles across the country, filtered into Resurrection City through this entry way at the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
                <p>Note the various types of structures visible in this image: hand-crafted shacks; plywood, triangular “tents”: and circus tents housing larger gathering spaces. These larger spaces served as information centers for new arrivals and visitors, as well as central meeting spots for marches and lobbying efforts throughout the District.</p>
                <p>Also note the condition of the ground in this photograph, which was likely taken several weeks into Resurrection City. The encampment was plagued almost from the start by heavy rainfall that quickly flooded this low-lying land next to the Tidal Basin along the Potomac River. The weather created quagmires of mud for residents to navigate - and also flooded their sewage and drainage systems, endangering public health standards and dampening morale. Residents and planners improvised, laying down a network of wooden planks throughout the City. Tunney Lee, an architect and planner from MIT involved in the early design stages of Resurrection City, noted that interiors of residential and service structures - from the humblest lean-to to the larger, more complex City Hall - remained protected from the elements. But the saturated earth was a persistent problem throughout the 43-day encampment.</p>

            <div class="list-item">
                <h3>2. Donation Tent</h3>
                <p>To the left of the Lincoln Memorial entryway, the Donation Tent was another popular gathering and organizing spot for residents of Resurrection City. Here, residents could find and swap clothing, toiletries, tools, and sundries. Resurrection City was supported by myriad charities and community organizations, near and far, many of whom had coordinated with the Poor People's Campaign before and during the caravans. Donated goods weren't limited to day-to-day needs - 300 gallons of paint and chairs and tables for the children's day care center were also donated to the encampment.</p>
                <p>On the edge of Resurrection City, not far from the entrance adjacent to the Donations Tent, a multi-agency coalition of health care providers set up a medical services and dental services trailer for residents. Medical teams began treating residents within the first week of opening, building on the extensive organizing and planning work of the Poor People's Campaign. Prior to departure, caravan participants across the country were screened for infections and offered medical treatment to limit the spread of contagious illness. This organizational infrastructure helped to support the efforts of health care providers in Resurrection City, who treated residents for illnesses and injuries incurred onsite and for chronic, long-standing conditions that stemmed from years of living in poverty. By mid-June, the medical team had installed a 75-foot trailer, complete with a pharmacy, lab, two exam rooms, a mental health room, and a waiting room, while dispatching groups of volunteers to circulate within the camp and provide treatment to residents.</p>

            <div class="list-item">
                <h3>3. Walking down Main Street</h3>
                <p>The rains started on May 23, and would continue for 11 of the next 14 days of Resurrection City. Over the course of the encampment, a total of 7.36 inches of rain would fall. At one point, the lowest-lying areas of the camp were under 6 inches of water. The wooden platforms, installed by volunteers and residents, offered some relief to inhabitants trying to navigate the muddy ground.</p>
                <p>This image illustrates several important dimensions of Resurrection City's infrastructure. The aforementioned walkways, installed to mitigate the impact of heavy rains, kept people flowing on the City's Main Street. Main Street was the primary hub for communication-related services, from physically moving individuals from place to place to share information and gossip, to the electricity powering the City's PA system. The cables crossing the center of this photograph transmitted electricity and telephone communications. Loudspeakers scattered throughout the encampment shared messages from City Hall about lost children or announced protests and marches.</p>
                <p>Over the course of Resurrection City's 43-day span, 540 tents (mostly simple plywood structures) would be constructed by teams of residents and volunteers to house nearly 3,000 people at its peak in early June. For this “City of a Thousand Designers,” planners sketched out a site that prioritized function over symbolism and form, inspired by the principles of classical modernist city planners and incorporating traditional elements like “Main Street.” Most of the construction occurred during the first two weeks of Resurrection City, sometimes building at a rate of one tent every fifteen minutes. Resurrection City had its own zip code (20013) and its own flag.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="list-item">
                <h3>4. Dining Tent</h3>
                <p>John Wiebenson, one of the architects and planners behind Resurrection City's technical planning, organized the encampment at multiple scales. The single residential tent -` a small one for families or a larger one for groups of five-six individuals - comprised the smallest scale. Units of nine residential tents, along with a toilet and shower facility, made up the next scale for a cohort of about 50 people. These units were then organized into four large compounds of roughly 200 people, complete with a group leader. These four large compounds were then grouped together to share a dining tent on Main Street.</p>
                <img src="./assets/images/TourImages/Stop_4_2.JPG" class="app-image" alt="Line at food counter">
                <p>During the planning phase, Wiebenson and his colleagues projected that at least three dining tents would operate in Resurrection City to serve all 3,000 residents. Unfortunately, the dense clusters of trees at the perimeter of the encampment - which provided shade, privacy, and shelter - limited the scale of the planners' ambitions. In the end, only one dining tent, pictured here, operated to feed the residents of Resurrection City. The heavy rains at the end of May caused the dining tent to collapse temporarily.</p>
                <img src="./assets/images/TourImages/Stop_4_3.JPG" class="app-image" alt="People eating in dining tent">
                <p>Food provision throughout the six weeks of the encampment was strained by limited resources. Demonstrators solicited private organizations, church groups, and the DC Health and Welfare Council for support, and Giant Foods, Inc., contributed 185,000 meals over the course of the month. Hot meals were rarely provided.</p>
                <img src="./assets/images/TourImages/Stop_4_4.JPG" class="app-image" alt="People standing at table in dining tent">
                <p>Despite the many challenges facing organizers and residents, the dining tent, like other common spaces in Resurrection City, served a vital function as a gathering spot, where news, gossip, advice, support, and food could be swapped and shared.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="list-item">
                <h3>5. View down Main Street</h3>
                 <p>According to Wiebenson, the primary criteria that guided design and construction in Resurrection City were:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>The provision of shelter and services for residents soon after their arrival</li>
                    <li>A "severe economy" of materials that welcomed improvisation</li>
                    <li>The full use of all available labor resources - volunteer labor was available in abundance</li>
                    <li>Durability of structures and infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Protection from the elements</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Planners and the demonstration's leadership had to grapple with several competing constraints and demands to both build Resurrection City and sustain it. The land, owned and stewarded by the federal government, could not be significantly altered. The dense groves of deciduous trees around the perimeter that hampered spatial cohesion for residential blocks had to remain intact. Organizers laid down planks and sheets of plywood to navigate the encroaching muddy swap, rather than truck in gravel. The extensive drainage systems that this population needed to support showers and handwashing sinks couldn't be built, forcing many residents to travel offsite to bathe. These limitations had significant impacts on day-to-day life within Resurrection City. As Wiebenson wrote, “As it happened…Resurrection City became more a demonstration of conditions that exist rather than those that could be.” In many ways, the material experience of life in Resurrection City mirrored the poverty and deprivation of residents' hometowns.</p>  
                <p>But Resurrection City wasn't just a victim of bad luck with the weather or highly constrained plans and construction - it was also indelibly shaped by the extraordinary scale of multi-agency government surveillance throughout the encampment, including the Poor People's Campaign caravans. It is estimated that an intelligence report from Resurrection City was generated every 30 minutes by the Interdivisional Intelligence Unit (comprised of the FBI, US Army Intelligence, US Border Patrol, the NPS Police, and the Metropolitan Police Department). The FBI, still under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover, was particularly aggressive in intelligence gathering and relied on a combination of undercover agents and phone taps. Some informants were recruited through the notorious COINTELPRO program as early as 1967 to infiltrate the various civil rights and Black Power organizations active in the Campaign. It was rumored, even during the period of the encampment, that undercover agents and assets deliberately stoked political and social unrest to destabilize the community and political leadership of Resurrection City.</p>
                <p>Much of the archival documentation we have on the day-to-day experiences of living in Resurrection City draws on these intelligence reports, which are remarkably detailed. It is the great irony of much of African American history that such a large measure of the archival evidence of political struggle can only be found in the records of state-sanctioned oppression. The case of Resurrection City is no different.</p>

                <h3>6. Inside Tent</h3>
                 <p>Over the course of Resurrection City, 540 plywood tents would be constructed in two sizes: slightly smaller structures that could accommodate families, and larger structures for groups of five to six individuals.</p>
                 <img src="./assets/images/TourImages/Stop_6_2.JPG" class="app-image" alt="Inside of multifamily tent">
                 <p>Shelters were constructed mainly by the people who would inhabit them. The simple design and materials used for the residential structures lent themselves to prefabrication systems, which encouraged residents at every skill level to participate and contribute.  Residents had free rein to customize their homes, whether by painting different slogans, names, or designs on them, or even creating second stories or decks with extra materials. On one tent, residents painted "I Have Lived in Many Houses. This Is My First Home."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="list-item">
                <h3>7. City Hall</h3>
                <p>Resurrection City Hall was located on Main Street, the central spine of the encampment and its main public space. City Hall served as a gathering point for residents, a point for printed and audio announcements to be posted, and the SCLC headquarters.</p>
                <img src="./assets/images/TourImages/Stop_7_2.jpg" class="app-image" alt="Ralph Abernathy speaking outside of City Hall">
                <p>Ralph Abernathy, pictured below, took over leadership of the SCLC after Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination earlier that spring. Abernathy arrived in Washington, D.C. to open Resurrection City on May 13, 1968, and drove the first stake into the ground. Day-to-day leadership, however, was handled by different leaders of the civil rights movement, including Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was briefly the City Manager before returning to Chicago.</p>
                <img src="./assets/images/TourImages/Stop_7_3.JPG" class="app-image" alt="People organizing inside of City Hall">
                <p>City Hall was an important base of operations: a centrally-located, well-constructed shelter with electricity and phone access where residents could organize for daily marches and lobbying efforts. Although much of the SCLC senior staff, including Abernathy, lived offsite at the nearby Pitt Motel, they spent most of their time onsite in City Hall.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="list-item">
                <h3>8. Day Care Center</h3>
                <p>During the planning phase, the SCLC had plans to set up Freedom Schools for older children while parents were marching and lobbying, while young children and babies would spend their days at a day care center operated by the National Capital Area Child Day Care Association. Unfortunately, there were not enough resources or staff to run Freedom Schools, and the day care center stood as the only childcare resource for the entire encampment.</p>
                <p>During the first days of Resurrection City, while construction was in full swing, children were bussed to offsite churches for day care. Resurrection City's day care was located on Main Street, several yards beyond City Hall towards the Washington Monument. The structure was roughly 20'x6' and housed three separate classrooms, along with a porch running the length of the center. Chairs and tables, along with chalkboards, toys, and clothing, were donated by area charities and churches.</p>
                <p>Within the building, one room was reserved for infants, with cribs and small beds. The remaining rooms were used by teachers, staff, and students for recreation, lessons, snack time, and naps. Much of the staff were social workers, teachers, childcare workers, and some were SCLC members using their vacation time to be at Resurrection City.</p>
                <p>Although the SCLC leaders had planned on a student-teacher ratio of 8:1, it quickly became clear that there were too many children onsite for the five permanent volunteers and a rotating staff of part time volunteers. Older children were taken off-site on field trips by volunteers from Georgetown University and Washington, D.C., to sightsee, get lunch, and receive hot baths. Younger children at the day care center had music time, story time, a snack, and lunch. Most of the day care center's food came from the nearby God's Eye Bakery in Resurrection City.</p>
                <p>Although the Freedom School never officially opened or matriculated students, it was constructed early that summer. A blackboard inside the unused building read:</p>
                <p>TODAY'S LESSON: VIOLENCE</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Why is there robbing and killing in the street?</li>
                    <li>Why are there people hungry?</li>

            <p>John Wiebenson, a professor of architecture at the University of Maryland, College Park, created these diagrams that show the purposeful mix of private and public areas created in Resurrection City, some of which were created in part by their design and others happened organically through use.</p>
            <img class="app-image" src="./assets/images/Wiebenson_1.png" alt="John Wiebenson Resurrection City schematic plan">
            <p>They designed the most public areas like the information center and registration booths, at the western edge of the main pedestrian entrance. Resurrection City's 'Main Street' was where reporters, celebrities, federal officials, and visitors could access the encampment when the city was open to the greater public.</p>
            <img class="app-image" src="./assets/images/Wiebenson_2.png" alt="John Wiebenson Resurrection City schematic plan">
            <p>Just as in any other 'city', Resurrection City's architects used a classic modernist city planning approach, with a main street, 'publicly' accessible service sites along the main axis, and clusters of different residential “neighborhoods” growing outward according to a loose but clear linear plan, neighborhoods of private living spaces. The story of Resurrection City as a complex but ephemeral settlement built in the midst of all the unquestioned permanence of the Mall's monuments is remarkable - and indiscernible to visitors today.</p>
